Run main.py to generate graph

Windows: GraphViz needs do be downloaded locally and 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Graphviz2.38/bin/' must be added to the path variables

Exogenous variable Inflow behaviour can be changed within main.py by the user using Inflow and cycle

For generating a trace specify start_state and end_state variables in main.py
